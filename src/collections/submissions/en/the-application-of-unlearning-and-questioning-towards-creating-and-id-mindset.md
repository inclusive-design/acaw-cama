The presentation introduces a transformative 'Unlearning and Questioning' (UQ) framework to advocate for Inclusive Design (ID) as a mindset. This framework involves deeply examining societal norms and biases through a five-step process. These steps include acknowledging human diversity, challenging existing norms, embracing societal complexities, adopting iterative co-design, and committing to inclusion. By applying these principles, the framework offers a comprehensive approach to cultivating an inclusive mindset in design and beyond, emphasizing continuous learning and adaptability. This research calls for a proactive engagement in unlearning and questioning as essential processes for personal, professional, and societal growth towards more inclusive and equitable environments.
