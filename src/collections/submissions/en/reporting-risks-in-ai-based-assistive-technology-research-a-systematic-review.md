This presentation investigates the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into assistive technologies for individuals with visual impairments. By conducting a systematic literature review, we explore how research in this area addresses and reports associated risks and failures. We aim to highlight the gaps in current research, particularly concerning comprehensive human evaluations within the sight-loss community and reporting failure cases and potential risks. Our study emphasizes the importance of transparent evaluations to ensure the safe and effective deployment of AI-based assistive technologies for individuals with visual impairments.
