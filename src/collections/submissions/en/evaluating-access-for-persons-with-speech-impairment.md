This research included different strategies to approach communication and access to systems (AAC systems, provider systems, social systems etc.).  The landscape of AAC communication tools for use in employment and the methods of evaluation and assessment for the technology were reviewed.  The current status of integration of persons with disabilities into the Canadian government workforce was evaluated.  An examination of access to the technology from the perspective of “if I am a Canadian who requires a form of AAC, how can I gain access?” was evaluated.  These two pilot studies were followed by interviews and focus groups to ensure that the “voice of the consumer” was heard.  Themes of importance were drawn from the rich discussions of the persons who are most familiar with the AAC systems and developed into a series of statements. These statements were presented back to members of the community through a Qualtrics survey to achieve consensus on those most important in the development of guidelines for better integration. The recommendations resulting from this iterative feedback are presented.
