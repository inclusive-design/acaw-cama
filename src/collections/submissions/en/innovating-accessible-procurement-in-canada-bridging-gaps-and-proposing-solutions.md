The products and services we purchase as an organization play a pivotal role in shaping accessibility and inclusion for individuals with disabilities. Inclusive and accessible procurement practices can ensure people with disabilities have equal opportunities to access the environments, services, tools, and infrastructure that support high-quality work environments, productivity, and longer-term career success.Our research reveals that accessibility and inclusion receive inadequate attention throughout the procurement cycle.Despite the widespread uptake of inclusive procurement strategies, challenges persist in implementing accessible procurement. Through our project, we are trying to uncover barriers to the implementation of accessibility and inclusion in the procurement process at different steps, identify the best practices and develop innovative solutions. To gain insights into the state of accessible procurement in Canada, CNIB research team developed a nationwide survey. To support the findings, the team engaged in expert consultations with stakeholders from sectors that have been able to implement accessible procurement across Canada, offering innovative solutions to address these challenges.During the presentation, we will talk about our findings and outline recommendations to bridge the identified gaps in procurement. We will explore some innovative mechanisms and best practices across the procurement process and supply chain management, aiming to foster a more inclusive and accessible environment for all individuals.
