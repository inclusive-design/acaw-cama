In this video presentation, four team members from the Accessibility Institute at Carleton University will discuss their current research into identifying accessibility gaps and removing barriers. Topics range from AI tools for disability assessment and accommodation plans, neuroinclusivity in housing and public policy, the impact of built environments on mental health, and acoustics accessibility in built spaces.
