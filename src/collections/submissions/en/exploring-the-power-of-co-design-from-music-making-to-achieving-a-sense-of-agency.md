My presentation talks about a group of adults with disabilities (Cerebral Palsy) who gather together every week and make music. They are called the Bliss i-Band. My role of being a companion to one of its members has inspired me to co-design this project with the i-Band. I aim to make their musical journey more accessible and independent.
