Digital expectations for children at school have gone soared in the last decade, and CNIB wants to ensure that children who are blind have the tools to succeed in these digital spaces. We are conducting a research project to understand if the gamification of Voiceover gestures and iPad orientation supports children who are blind under 7 to learn digital literacy skills that will prepare them for school. Using principles from the evolving curriculums across Canada, we have developed an app with games to practise skills and another app for teachers and caregivers to learn about the skills and support the children through their journey. We are excited to share our findings with interested folks come April 2025. We will take our findings to empower policy makers to foster change, and for educators looking to expand their resources and offerings.
