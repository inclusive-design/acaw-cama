My research project focuses on creating an interactive and accessible web experience consisting of personal stories of a dyslexic adult with late detection.I share emotional and informational aspects of my personal stories about discovering being dyslexic as an adult and other aspects of dyslexia in an engaging manner for the audience. Through my research, I share my learnings, retrospections, and observations in the form of stories and provide a repository of valuable existing resources (videos, podcasts, books, and articles) to understand better the emotional and behavioural characteristics of a dyslexic adult. The inclusive design approach ensures an adaptive ecosystem, embracing diversity and differences and creating an accessible experience. The interactive documentary, narrative, and information visualisation layers represent personal data in a storytelling format.
