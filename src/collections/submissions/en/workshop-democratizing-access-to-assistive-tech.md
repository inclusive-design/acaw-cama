The process of acquiring AT is fraught with gaps, inconsistencies, and frustrations from the user’s perspective. In most jurisdictions, there are usually multiple government programs to support user’s in acquiring the AT they need, but often, user’s find the processes confusing, onerous, difficult to navigate, and the supports often don’t cover the tech user’s actually use and need. Government policy-makers often fail to create programs that actually meet the needs of AT users, create policies that conflict with each other, or fail to keep pace with the fast-changing AT environment. In this workshop, we are going to have a conversation around how to overcome these challenges from both the user and policy perspectives and explore solutions together.
