The presentation offers a glimpse into the Bliss Bot Project, which involves co-creating an assisted communication tool with users of augmentative and alternative communication technologies who are proficient in Blissymbolics supported by the use of Large Language Models/ Artificial Intelligence. Together with a multidisciplinary team, we are developing customizable artificial intelligence communication tools that enable the use of Blissymbolics as a form of semantic shorthand. This tool aims to replicate the role of familiar listeners by transforming Bliss messages into contextually relevant messages suitable for unfamiliar listeners, particularly in employment and various social settings.
