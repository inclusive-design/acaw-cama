Mohsen (Moisen) Mahjoobnia, a Ph.D. candidate at University College Dublin, explores the essence of Inclusive Design as more than just a set of design principles; he sees it as a life philosophy that necessitates a paradigm shift towards valuing human diversity at its core. In his talk, Moisen emphasizes the importance of 'unlearning and questioning' ingrained biases and societal norms, advocating for a process that recognizes the vast spectrum of human diversity and challenges conventional assumptions. Through personal anecdotes and insights from leaders in Inclusive Design, he illustrates how this mindset can lead to a more equitable and empathetic society. Moisen proposes a framework centered around acknowledging diversity, challenging conventions, embracing complexity, iterative co-design, and a commitment to inclusion. This approach, he argues, is pivotal in fostering societal transformation towards inclusivity at all levels. He underscores the interconnectedness of human beings and the shared responsibility to foster an inclusive world, positioning Inclusive Design as a critical lens for reimagining our collective approach to design, interaction, and community building.
