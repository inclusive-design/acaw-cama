This presentation discusses the recommendations on accessible and inclusive virtual and blended service provision models for the Federal Public Service and federally regulated industries in post-COVID-19 Canada. The recommendations will address sensory disabilities involving changes in sense processing (vision and hearing) and including sight loss. The objectives of this presentation are to (1) understand existing service provision accessibility standards, practices (whether formal or informal), and associated accessibility legislation to identify innovation opportunities and (2) work with constituents (all stakeholders and core partners of the project) to co-design possibilities for what the current tools offer and what future tools should afford.
