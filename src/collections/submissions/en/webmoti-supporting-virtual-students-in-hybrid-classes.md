This presentation will be about a study on a video conferencing system called WebMoti 2.0 that has been designed to help aid neurodiverse students to better attend hybrid classes without feeling left out of class discussions. The study's purpose is to understand if a neurodiverse student in a hybrid class can ask and answer questions, participate in class discussion and balance their sensory needs better with the use of assisted technology like WebMoti 2.0. The study tests it usability and usefulness of WebMoti 2.0 for attending and participating in a class for neurodiverse students, only analyzing how the virtual student interacts with WebMoti.
